<h1> I love tacos! </h1>

<p> There are so many delish tacos! </p>

<%
    fillings = ["Carnitas", "Al Pastor", "Steak", "Fish", "Vegetables"]
%>

<p>
    Currently, there are <%= fillings.count %> kinds of tacos:
</p>

<ul>
    <!-- <% is ruby code 
    and <li> is for HTML purpose
    That's why "for" and "end" are in different % -->
    <% for taco in fillings %>
        <li><%= taco %></li>
    <% end %>
</ul>
